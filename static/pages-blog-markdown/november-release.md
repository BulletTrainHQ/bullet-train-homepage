This month has been mainly about stability and tightening up our infrastructure with all the load, stress and peak tests under the sun!

However, a couple notable improvements have been made.

- One of our customers highlighted an issue with [toggling issues whilst filtering](https://github.com/BulletTrainHQ/bullet-train-frontend/issues/8)
- When calling identify, characters that needed URL encoding are now supported.
- For all the users using our core REST API, we have added cURL snippets

If there are any other improvements that you'd like to see us make, feel free to leave a comment!
