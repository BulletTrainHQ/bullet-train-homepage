We are excited to announce a new feature, webhooks for feature flags! This is a feature we have had in the making for a long time due to a need from one of our valued customers.

Webhooks are very powerful, with these you have everything you need to perfectly cache your feature flags - **bringing down your costs**. Though this is only one of your use cases, you can use this information for many things internally, such as auditing or triggering emails.

You might think we'd hide such a feature behind a premium paywall since you can use it to pay us less! However, when starting Bullet Train we set out the rule that we would never force users to pay more for additional features. 

## How do I use them?

Within your project, you configure webhooks per environment in the **Environment settings** section. This screenshot shows how we use webhooks in our development environment.

We hope you enjoy this new feature. If you any questions about this feature feel free to comment here!
