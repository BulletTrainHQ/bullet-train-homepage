After some brief discussion between the members of Bullet Train, we concluded that it was time to say goodbye to Intercom.

It never hurts to keep an open mind with SaaS tooling, especially around price. Strangely enough, there aren't that many competitors to Intercom, Freshchat was really the only one that stood out, and the price difference for our use-case was rather big!

The second point that swayed our move to change was complexity. We don't want or need more than a simple chatbot so that we can respond to your queries, that's it. For us, Intercom does a bit too much for our liking, and it's rather confusing to use.

So, from now on, say Hello to Freshchat!
