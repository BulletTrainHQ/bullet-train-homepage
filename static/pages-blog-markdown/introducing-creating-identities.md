We are excited to announce a new feature, creating identities from the Flagsmith Dashboard! This is a feature requested from of our new customers.

Identity management has been around in Flagsmith for a long time now, you can manage feature flags and remote config for individual identities as well as segments. This means you can control the experience of a particular user, which is very useful for testing in production!

This new feature is useful if you want to add users to Flagsmith from day 1 so that you can start managing features for them before they use your application.
 
 Without this feature, identities would only be created within Flagsmith by using one of our SDKs identify functions.

## How do I use this?

Within your project, you create identities per environment in the **User** section. This screenshot shows how we use the create identities feature.
