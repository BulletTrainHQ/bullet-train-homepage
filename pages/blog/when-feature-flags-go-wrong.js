He gives us the sorry tale of the the market trading company
                                Knight Capital. Knight Capital were happily and innocently testing in QA their new
                                feature for making rapid automated trades, doing everything by the book, it all worked,
                                and now they knew they were ready to deploy to production.
                            </p>
                            <p className="blog-post__text">Except.</p>
                            <p className="blog-post__text">
They had already had a feature toggle to do these trades
                                before. 8 years before. And when they deployed to their servers, one of those servers
                                did not have the toggle for the new feature, but instead of just not doing anything, the
                                server used the old feature flag. It therefore started making as many trades as fast as
                                it possibly could, without limit.
                            </p>
                            <p className="blog-post__text">
Long story short, rolling back didn’t work, so they solved
                                the problem by switching off the feature toggle. They then presumably sat in their
                                office in sickened silence for a bit. Because, the impact of those rapidly made
                                automated trades was very very bad.

Andy also gives us some examples of feature toggles done well, he’s a proponent of
                                trunk-based delivery, he takes us through the four types of toggles (compile toggles,
                                startup toggles for microservices, periodic toggles, and activity toggles) and
                                accidentally invents the word “contrologging”, controlling with toggles, which should
                                totally be a thing.

Edith is a firm believer in feature flags, and she also lists
                            good use cases for them, including uses such as kill switches. Intriguingly she also
                            includes an example of feature flags used for customer experience and marketing
                            purposes:

The example is to do with early releases, some people really like
                            getting early access to things and feature flags can facilitate that, meaning you’re able to
                            control those early releases for PR purposes, premium clients or brand fans — a really
                            powerful thing to do. And vice versa, some people hate getting early releases, like B2B
                            software users who are used to what the tool is right now and hate changes. Feature flags
                            mean they don’t get those new changes until they’re cast iron and as bug free as Dettol.

These guys didn’t properly look after their old feature flags
                            either. But we’re focusing on another mistake too: they gave access to almost everybody,
                            even non-devs.

In the business context, it made sense, but still. Humans were

The problem came home to roost when one day the company realised
                            that no one could upload a file to the CMS. This escalated quickly to the CEO who was
                            getting bombarded with angry phone calls from customers.

                        <p className="blog-post__text">
Three hours later they discovered the issue was caused by an old
                            feature flag which had been turned off, be it through fat fingers or obtuseness. The feature
                            flag had been designed to throttle traffic which is an admirable reason for a feature flag,
                            but now it was crippling the whole product.
                        </p>
                        <p className="blog-post__text">
The immediate solution was simple. They switched the feature flag
                            back on, and everything worked again.

But what horrifies me is that as Edith says in the video, the
                            company didn’t then actually take further action. “We didn’t really know what it did so we
                            left it there.” Oof.

                        <p className="blog-post__text">
Ok fine, at least they made sure only those qualified to touch it
                            were able to access it?
                        </p>
                        <p className="blog-post__text">Nope.</p>
                        <p className="blog-post__text">
They left it unsecured and open to basically any employee.
                            Instead they just put a label on it, which said “do not ever touch this button.”

                        <p className="blog-post__text">
The last we hear about this company is that they still haven’t
                            limited access or removed the old feature flag. Yes, the “do not touch touch” label is still
                            there, but it’s now “DO NOT EVER TOUCH THIS BUTTON”.
