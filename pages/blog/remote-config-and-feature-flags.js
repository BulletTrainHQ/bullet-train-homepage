                  A Feature Flag is a technique to turn some functionality of your application off,
                  via configuration, without deploying new code. If you’re employing CI/CD and
                  releasing
                  often they’re pretty important.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                  With bullet train feature flags can be turned on and off per environment, also you
                  can enable flags for specific users. For example, this could be used to show
                  features to your internal team in production or for beta testers.
                              </p>

                  It's great being able to turn features on and off without doing a build, but with
                  some
                  features,
                  it's not as simple as that. This is where remote config comes in.
                  Often there's a need to configure feature properties, for example updating some text
                  to
                  promote an
                  in-app currency sale or even the copy on our homepage.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                  Similarly with feature flags, Bullet Train lets you configure these per environment
                  and for specific users. With our upcoming user segments feature, this could be used
                  to show different messaging or environment variables to power user groups,
                  mobile/browser specific users and
                  much more.

                      <p>
              People who are not used to continuous integration might be wondering: why didn't I just
              release the feature the way I normally would? Some of the reasons for feature flags being
              such a good approach:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>
                It introduces the ability to test code in production with gradual/targeted rollouts to
                specific
                users.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                It empowers non-technical team members to manage feature releases.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                It enables testing of features early, against an up-to-date codebase. CI means we're
                constantly
                testing features on a very close representation to what is running in production.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                It allows you to introduce beta programs to get early user feedback.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                It reduces the need to rollback code with the ability to turn off features remotely in
                the
                event
                of an emergency.
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                  </div>
              </FormGroup>
          </div>
